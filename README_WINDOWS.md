WISKI CSV Translator : Windows
------------------------------

Newlines
========

This program depends on having a version of Python with
Universal Newline support. You probably do, don't worry.

Finding Python
==============

Python is probably located in C:\Python26 or C:\Python27
on your Windows machine, if you used the Python.org installer,
and it's likely *not* in your $PATH.

You ought to be able to run **wiski.py** if you're in its
working directory with the following from cmd.exe:

C:\Python27\python.exe wiski.py ARGUMENTS
